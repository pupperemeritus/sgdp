# **Indian Weather Explorer: A Deep Dive into GSOD Data with R & Shiny**

This project provides a complete workflow for transforming raw, complex weather data from the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) dataset into actionable, interactive insights. With a specific focus on stations across India, the entire pipeline—from data acquisition and cleaning to exploratory analysis and the deployment of web applications—is implemented using R and Shiny, with an initial assist from Python.

The core objective is to make decades of historical weather data accessible and easy to explore. We've developed a robust data pipeline to handle the complexities of the raw data and built a suite of interactive Shiny dashboards for visualization, clustering, extreme event analysis, and forecasting.

## **The Data Pipeline: From Raw Archives to Clean Data**

A significant portion of this project is dedicated to a multi-step pipeline that ensures the data is clean, organized, and analysis-ready.

1. **Automated Download & Extraction**: A Python script kicks off the process by automatically downloading yearly `tar.gz` archives (1929–2023) from the NCEI/NOAA data source. It uses parallel processing to speed up the task and cleans up the archives afterward.
2. **Filtering for India**: R scripts take over to process the extracted files, first organizing the global data by station and then filtering for Indian stations. To ensure data quality, only stations with at least **four years** of records are kept.
3. **Cleaning & Transformation**: The combined Indian data undergoes rigorous cleaning.
   - **Missing Values**: Placeholder values like `9999.9` are replaced with `NA`, and columns with over 20% missing data are dropped.
   - **Unit Conversion**: All measurements are standardized to SI units. For instance, temperature is converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula: $T_C = (T_F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}$.
   - **Feature Engineering**: The cryptic 6-digit `FRSHTT` (Fog, Rain, Snow, etc.) bitmask is decoded into six clear, separate binary columns, making event-based analysis straightforward.

The final, polished dataset is saved as `cleaned_data.csv`, ready for analysis.

## **Interactive Analysis with Shiny Apps**

While static plots like time-series graphs and correlation heatmaps provide initial insights, the heart of this project lies in the interactive applications built with R Shiny. These tools empower users to dynamically explore the data without writing any code.

- **Weather Station Explorer**: An interactive Leaflet map where users can select any weather station from a dropdown menu to view its location, average yearly temperature, and most common weather event.
- **Seasonal Weather Clustering**: This app uses **k-means clustering** to group stations with similar weather patterns. Users can toggle between seasons (Winter, Summer, Monsoon, etc.) to see how these clusters shift throughout the year.
- **Extreme Weather Event Analyzer**: A tool for identifying and visualizing outliers. Users can select a weather attribute (like Temperature or Precipitation), a station, and an extremity level (e.g., 3 standard deviations from the mean) to see a chart of when extreme events occurred.
- **Forecasting Suite**: A set of dashboards for time-series forecasting. Users can select a station and generate temperature forecasts using various models, including **SARIMA**, **ARIMA**, and **Random Forest**, and review model performance metrics.
