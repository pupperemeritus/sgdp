I started a progressive rock and metal band with my friend Dhruv Prakash from Mumbai, so far we have released 1 single. We have more in the works.

You can find it streaming on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/0KPEZYlJGEYC6NHj63AsJu?si=734c81b4fe844325) and [other streaming services](https://linktr.ee/cosmitechts)

We draw influences ranging from progressive rock, progressive metal, jazz, fusion, classical and many more.

Hope you enjoy :)
