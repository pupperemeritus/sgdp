## Summary

I have led the tech team of CBIT Open Source Community to create the above two websites for the CBIT Hacktoberfest Hackathon 2023.
It had everything, exhilarating deadlines, endless stream of bugs and a nightmare to fix the responsiveness.

My contributions to the project were

1. Project architecture and tech stack decision.
2. I implemented the custom form that used google form as its backend and seamlessly weaved into the styling of the website. Involved looking at the source of the original google form and emulating behaviour of the original form.
3. I came up with the idea of a horizontally scrolling timeline which was then brought to life by my teammate Sai Kiran.
4. Implementing FAQ Section.
5. Miscellaneous styling across components.
