### Work Experience Summary

- [Implemented, tested and documented](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/737) the Lomb-Scargle Power/Cross Spectrum in Python for Stingray 2, contributing to a [JOSS Publication](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.07389).

- [Reduced memory usage of _EventList.from_lc_](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/756) from $$\mathcal{O}{(n)}$$ to $$\mathcal{O}{(1)}$$ using generator comprehension for large dataset optimization.

- [Corrected plotting issues](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/747) preventing unintended absolution of real/imaginary parts.

- Resolved [dynamical power spectrum duplication](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/776) ($$save_all option$$), halving CPU operations and memory writes.}
